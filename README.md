## COVID-19 Dashboard Project Overview

This project involved creating a dynamic and insightful COVID-19 dashboard using Power BI, based on global data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The aim was to analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 across various regions and countries and present the findings through interactive and meaningful visualizations.

The primary objectives of this project were:
1. **Track COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Over Time by Region:** We developed Area charts to visualize the progression of COVID-19 cases and deaths across different WHO regions. This allowed us to observe the spread and impact of the pandemic in various parts of the world.
2. **Detect Patterns and Trends:** Through the use of bar and line charts, we identified notable patterns in the data, such as spikes in cases and deaths during different time periods, providing insight into the ebb and flow of the pandemic.
3. **Plot Weekly Moving Averages:** To smooth out daily fluctuations, we calculated and plotted the weekly moving average of COVID-19 cases and deaths, which highlighted longer-term trends and helped remove noise from the data.
4. **Country-Wise Analysis with Monthly Filtering:** Using bar charts, we visualized the total number of cases by country and added a slicer for monthly filtering, enabling detailed exploration of the data across time periods.
5. **Mapping COVID-19 Intensity:** A filled map chart was created to display the geographic distribution and intensity of COVID-19 cases across countries, offering a clear picture of global hotspots.
6. **Region and Country Hierarchy:** We established a hierarchy of WHO regions and countries using Donut chart, which enabled us to pinpoint the regions and countries most severely affected by the virus.

We used a variety of Power BI visualizations:
- **Line and Bar Charts:** To track trends over time.
- **Map Charts:** For geographical analysis.
- **Dounut chart:** To explore hierarchical data.
- **Slicers and Filters:** To enable interactive data exploration by region and time period.

### Conclusion

The COVID-19 dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the pandemic, allowing users to interactively explore and analyze global trends. This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in making complex datasets more accessible and insightful.
